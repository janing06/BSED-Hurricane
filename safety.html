              Hurricanes are colossal meteorological systems that originate from oceanic bodies and frequently advance towards land. Hurricanes are characterized by strong winds, intense rainfall, storm surge (an increase in water level), flooding, and tornadoes. The severity of these storms poses a significant threat and has the potential to inflict extensive damage on areas located far from the coast.

          <li>
            Steer clear of electricity lines, poles, and wires that have been damaged or fallen. They have the potential to provide an electric shock that might be fatal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid contact with floodwaters as they may be contaminated with sewage, bacteria, and chemicals that can cause illness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take measures to mitigate the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. It is imperative to avoid using gasoline, propane, natural gas, or charcoal-burning equipment indoors, such as in a home, basement, garage, tent, or camper. It is equally important to refrain from using them outside in close proximity to an open window. Carbon monoxide is both invisible and odorless, yet it has the potential to cause rapid fatality. If you experience symptoms such as nausea, lightheadedness, or fatigue, promptly seek fresh air without any delay.
